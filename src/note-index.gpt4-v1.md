// This task involves multiple steps to be done correctly, because the Github API isn't exactly designed for this specific kind of query. You would have to:

// Get a list of repositories. Unfortunately, you can't get all of the public repositories using the GitHub API, it has a limit. But, you can get a list of repositories by a certain criteria (like most starred JavaScript repositories).
// For each repository, get a list of pull requests authored by Dependabot.
// Check if the pull request patches a “security-related dependency vulnerability”. This is quite tricky because GitHub API does not provide such specific information directly. You might have to check the pull request body or comments for certain keywords indicating a security patch. Alternatively, if the project uses GitHub's Dependabot alerts, there may be a link between the security alert and the pull request in the form of a commit SHA.

// improve the "Get a list of repositories" part, by adding these criteria:
// 1 "starred"
// 2 "non-forked"
// 3 "more than 20 commits"
// Unfortunately, the GitHub API doesn't support searching repositories by number of commits directly. You can, however, filter by stars and whether the repository is a fork. After retrieving the repositories, you would need to fetch their commit counts individually, which would increase the number of API calls.
